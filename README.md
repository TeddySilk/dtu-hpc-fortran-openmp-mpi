# 41391 - High Performance Computing: FORTRAN, OpenMP, and MPI
This repo contains the exercise solutions and project files for the PhD course "41391 High Performance Computing: Fortran, OpenMP and MPI" given at DTU.

Excuse the dust, as it is a work-in-progress.

# To-Do List
A to-do list is kept here for future reference to track outstanding issues in the repo.
- [ ] \(exercises/openmp/poisson) Implement OpenMP properly in the Poisson problem exercise, and set-up easy benchmarking, including CPU up-time extraction.
- [x] \(exercises/mpi/mpi_heat_diffusion) Implement "STAT=info" checks for all array allocations.
- [x] \(exercises/mpi/mpi_heat_diffusion) Fix output name when resuming simulation.
